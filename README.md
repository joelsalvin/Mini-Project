# Mini-Project
Automation of game using OpenCV is a project that put forward the idea or context of controlling a game using gestures using the OpenCV library, a programming function mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. This can improve the hands-free gaming experience by controlling a game using various gestures. This can be made possible by training the system with various hand movements with the help of MediaPipe. 
The Repository contains 
1. A packman inspired game called packminion built on Javafx
2. Automation model for gesture recognition and the ipynb file for colab
